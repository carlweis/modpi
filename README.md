#ModPi
Flask based modular application generator, similar to rails; but for python.
ModPi allows you to quickly generate applications using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Gulp and more.

### Build and scaffold applications fast, just like you can in rails.
Fully automated development, with generators for modules, views, layouts, routes, stylesheets, javascripts.

### Gulp Support for Asset management, fully-automated
Automatic import of module sass files, and javascripts using gulp. This is hands off, it just works :).

### Database Migrations 
Includes easy commands like db create, db create:migration create_users_table and db migrate 

### Lots more to come.
This is my first project in python, built in a few days. It works flawlessly thus far, and I will be
continuing to improve it, as I get through this massive python book (Learning Python). If you want to
help and improve the generate, please fork the repo and submit your pull-requests.

I hope you enjoy all of the extra time you save, while *ModPi* does the grunt work for you.

Happy Coding.
