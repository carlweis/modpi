# ModPi

ModPi is a Flask-based modular application generator, inspired by Rails but designed for Python. With ModPi, you can quickly scaffold applications using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Gulp, and more.

## Rapid Application Development Made Easy

ModPi streamlines your development process with automated generators for modules, views, layouts, routes, stylesheets, and JavaScript. Build and scaffold your applications with ease, just like in Rails.

## Seamless Asset Management with Gulp

Effortlessly manage assets with Gulp integration. ModPi automatically imports your module-specific SASS files and JavaScript. Once set up, it runs smoothly in the background, requiring no additional effort from you.

## Database Migrations Simplified
Easily handle database migrations with simple commands like:

- db create
- db create:migration create_users_table
- db migrate
